## 📖 About

NoorKids is a children's app built around a collection of Prophet stories including Hazrat Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Yousaf, Suleman, and many more. Every story can be read on screen, listened to as narrated Urdu audio, discussed with an AI companion that answers questions about that specific story, and reviewed through a short quiz. The app also keeps track of what each child has read so far and how much time they have spent reading.

It is built for two kinds of people at once. Children around five to ten years old will use it directly, and parents will want to feel confident it is trustworthy, well made, and worth their child's time.

## ✨ Features

📚 A growing library of Prophet stories written in Urdu, with English titles and categories so parents can browse easily.

🤖 An AI companion named Noor that a child can chat with after reading a story. It only answers using that story's own content, in a warm and gentle tone suited to young children.

🔊 A listen feature that plays natural Urdu narration for each story, with the ability to pause, seek, and change the playback speed.

📝 A short quiz for every story, generated from the story's own content, with instant feedback and a final score.

📊 Progress tracking that remembers the last story a child read, how much of each story they have completed, and their total reading time.

🔐 Accounts and profiles, including email sign up and Google sign in, along with a short profile setup step for each child.

🛠️ An admin panel, separate from the main app, where new stories can be uploaded and registered users can be reviewed.

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Partners & Developers)

### What you will need

You will need Node.js version 18 or later, a free Supabase project, and a Groq API key.

### Installing the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OwaisTanoli71/noorkids-app.git
cd NoorKidsApp

cd client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
```

### Setting up your environment variables

Your repository contains `.env.example` files. You must duplicate them and rename them to `.env`.

Create `.env` inside the `client` folder with the following:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Create `.env` inside the `server` folder with the following:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

Please keep both of these files private and out of version control. They are already listed in `.gitignore`.

### Setting up the database

This project uses a shared Supabase database. As long as you have the correct `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your client `.env` file, the app will automatically connect to the database!

### Adding and processing stories

New stories are added as `.docx` or `.pdf` files inside the `stories` folder at the root of the project. Once a story is added, run the following from inside the `server` folder:

```bash
npm run build:stories
npm run build:quizzes
npm run build:audio
```

These three commands read the story text, build the search index the AI companion uses, generate a quiz using Groq, and generate the narrated audio using Google TTS.

### Running the app

Run the server from inside the server folder and the client from inside the client folder, each in its own terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default the client will run at http://localhost:5173 and the server at http://localhost:5000.
